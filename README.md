Charlotte PowerShell User Group meeting presentation - Aug 1, 2019
https://www.meetup.com/Charlotte-PowerShell-Users-Group/events/nqdwkpyzlbcb/

## Details (From Meetup.com)

Join us as David Stein of Catapult Systems shares with us some of the scripts and tools he has developed. We'll start off with our new speaker challenge to tell us about their favorite cmdlet and why. Then we'll move into some of the goodness David has used. Could be a little bit of everything. Documenting PowerShell scripts and generating markdown files using Platyps or building a library of SQL queries as stored files and using PowerShell to run them and return results for processing. It's going to be great!

We will have a Teams meeting available for remote attendees for this meeting.
